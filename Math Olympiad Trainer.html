                The Bank of Oslo issues two types of coin: aluminium (denoted \(A\)) and bronze (denoted \(B\)). Marianne has \(n\) aluminium coins and \(n\) bronze coins, arragned in a row in some arbitrary initial order. A <i>chain</i> is any subsequence of consecutive coins of the same type. Given a fixed positive integer \(k\leqslant 2n\), Marianne repeatedly performs the following operation: she identifies the longest chain containing the \(k\)<sup>th</sup> coin from the left, and moves all coins in that chain to the left end of the row. For example, if \(n=4\) and \(k=4\), the process starting from the ordering \(AABBBABA\) would be $$AAB\underline{B}BABA\rightarrow BBB\underline{A}AABA\rightarrow AAA\underline{B}BBBA\rightarrow BBB\underline{B}AAAA\rightarrow BBB\underline{B}AAAA\rightarrow\dots .$$ Find all pairs \((n,k)\) with \(1\leqslant k\leqslant 2n\) such that for every initial ordering, at some moment during the process, the leftmost \(n\) coins will all be of the same type.
