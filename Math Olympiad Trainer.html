                The Bank of Oslo issues two types of coin: aluminium (denoted \(A\)) and bronze (denoted \(B\)). Marianne has \(n\) aluminium coins and \(n\) bronze coins, arragned in a row in some arbitrary initial order. A <i>chain</i> is any subsequence of consecutive coins of the same type. Given a fixed positive integer \(k\leqslant 2n\), Marianne repeatedly performs the following operation: she identifies the longest chain containing the \(k\)<sup>th</sup> coin from the left, and moves all coins in that chain to the left end of the row. For example, if \(n=4\) and \(k=4\), the process starting from the ordering \(AABBBABA\) would be $$AAB\underline{B}BABA\rightarrow BBB\underline{A}AABA\rightarrow AAA\underline{B}BBBA\rightarrow BBB\underline{B}AAAA\rightarrow BBB\underline{B}AAAA\rightarrow\dots .$$ Find all pairs \((n,k)\) with \(1\leqslant k\leqslant 2n\) such that for every initial ordering, at some moment during the process, the leftmost \(n\) coins will all be of the same type.

                The Bank of Bath issues coins with an \(H\) on one side and a \(T\) on the other. Harry has \(n\) of these coins arranged in a line from left to right. He repeatedly performs the following operation: if there are exactly \(k > 0\) coins showing \(H\), then he turns over the \(k\)<sup>th</sup> coin from the left; otherwise, all coins show \(T\) and he stops. For example, if \(n=3\) the process starting with the configuration \(THT\) would be \(THT\rightarrow HHT\rightarrow HTT\rightarrow TTT\), which stops after three operations. <br> <br> (a) Show that, for each initial configuration, Harry stops after a finite number of operations. <br> <br> (b) For each initial configuration \(C\), let \(L(C)\) be the number of operations before Harry stops.
