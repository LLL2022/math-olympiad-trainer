Find the number of ways to assign representatives to all non-empty subsets of \(S\) so that if a subset \(D\subseteq S\) is a disjoint union of non=empty subsets \(A, B, C\subseteq S\), then the representative of \(D\) is also the representative of at least one of \(A, B, C\).;

APMO 2014/4;0;N/A;;C;Let \(n\) and \(b\) be positive integers. We say \(n\) is \(b\)-<i>discerning</i> if there exists a set consisting of \(n\) different positive integers less than \(b\) that has no two different subsets \(U\) and \(V\) such that the sum of all elements in \(U\) equal the sum of all elements in \(V\). <br> <br> (a) Prove that \(8\) is a \(100\)-discerning. <br> (b) Prove that \(9\) is not \(100\)-discerning. ;
APMO 2014/5;0;N/A;;G;Circles \(\omega\) and \(\Omega\) meet at points \(A\) and \(B\). Let \(M\) be the midpoint of the arc \(AB\) of circle \(\omega\) (\(M\) lies inside \(\Omega\)). A chord \(MP\) of circle \(\omega\) intersects \(\Omega\) at \(Q\) (\(Q\) lies inside \(\omega\)). Let \(\ell_P\) be the tangent line to \(\omega\) at \(P\), and let \(\ell_Q\) be the tangent line to \(\Omega\) at \(Q\). Prove that the circumcircle of the triangle formed by the lines \(\ell_P\), \(\ell_Q\), and \(AB\) are tangent to \(\Omega\).;
