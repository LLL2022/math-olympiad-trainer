IMO 2019/5	0	N/A		C	"The Bank of Bath issues coins with an \(H\) on one side and a \(T\) on the other. Harry has \(n\) of these coins arranged in a line from left to right. He repeatedly performs the following operation: if there are exactly \(k > 0\) coins showing \(H\), then he turns over the \(k\)<sup>th</sup> coin from the left; otherwise, all coins show \(T\) and he stops. For example, if \(n=3\) the process starting with the configuration \(THT\) would be \(THT\rightarrow HHT\rightarrow HTT\rightarrow TTT\), which stops after three operations. <br> <br> (a) Show that, for each initial configuration, Harry stops after a finite number of operations. <br> <br> (b) For each initial configuration \(C\), let \(L(C)\) be the number of operations before Harry stops. For example, \(L(THT)=3\) and \(L(TTT)=0\). Determine the average value of \(L(C)\) over all \(2^n\) possible initial configurations \(C\)."
